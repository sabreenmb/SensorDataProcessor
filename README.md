we found some issues in this code 
- The constructor name different from the class name 
- There is no import for BufferedWriter 
- There is no import for FileWriter
- remove unused initialization for i in the average method
- remove the continue statement because it is unused the code will continue if it does not meet any conduction
- replace the general exception with proper exception handling to throw a custom exception.
